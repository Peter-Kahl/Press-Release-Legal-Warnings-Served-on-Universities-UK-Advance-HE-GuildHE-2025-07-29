Today (29 July 2025), I’ve formally issued legal warnings to three influential UK higher education sector bodies—Universities UK, Advance HE, and GuildHE. These organisations publicly position themselves as charities working in the public interest yet simultaneously advocate strongly for member institutions, raising significant fiduciary and governance conflicts.

Drawing on my detailed analysis published in the paper ‘Rot at the Heart of Higher Education’, these legal notices explicitly require immediate clarification on how each organisation manages conflicts between their member advocacy roles and wider fiduciary duties under the Charities Act 2011, statutory obligations under the Companies Act 2006 (Section 172), and equality duties under the Equality Act 2010.

Failure to respond transparently and publicly may lead to further legal and regulatory escalation.

Democratic governance demands transparency and accountability. Your engagement and comments are very welcome.
